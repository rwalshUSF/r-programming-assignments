    "text": "This my first post for my LIS4370 blog. Welcome!\nTask # 1\nI have successfully created a GitHub repository named: r-programming-assignments\nHere is a screenshot of the repository and README.md:\n\nTasks # 2 & 3\nI have also created a blog titled “R Programming Journal – Robert Walsh”.\nHere is a screenshot of the blog and installed R Studio console:\n\nThe installation of R Studio was straightforward, mainly because I had already installed the program and IDE on my machine for a different course here at USF. One issue I had was connecting the blog project to the new GitHub repository. I resolved this problem by copying the commands that GitHub generated when the repository was created and then running them in the R Studio terminal. This worked well and connected the R Studio blog project to the Git Hub version control repository. A second issue that I encountered was software updates. I had not used R Studio for quite some time; therefore, I needed to complete some updates. After the updates were completed, I was able to use the software and the IDE. I am currently on a Windows 11 PC, using version ‘R 4.4.2’ and R Studio version ‘2024.12.0.467’.\nTask # 4\nWhen using the R programming language, vectors are fundamental objects or entities that serve as containers for storing data elements or data values. Vector container objects can be used in various ways to store data in the computer’s memory, and the vector addresses/information can be referenced at a later time, throughout the program to recall the values that are stored within them. Vectors are fundamental to data analysis in R because they have the ability and flexibility to have descriptive names that represent the data that they contain. The functions and applications in R Programming utilize the vector abstraction ability to enable programs to perform vector math and use vector elements as input parameters in functions. Results from calculations and analysis can be updated and stored in new or existing vectors, allowing further data analysis."

The means for each poll are rather close with ABC_poll = ~24 and CBS_poll ~27 for a difference of ~3. The medians have slightly more variance as the ABC_polls = 15 and the CBS_polls = 19, a difference of 4. The ranges are close as well with the ABC_polls ranging from 2-62 and the CBS_polls from 1-75.\nWhen the ‘Diff’ column is calculated with CBS_poll-ABC_poll values: Donald shows the largest positive discrepancies and Ted shows the largest negative discrepancies.\nWhen the ‘Diff’ column is calculated with ABC_poll-CBS_poll values: Ted shows the largest positive discrepancies and Donald shows the largest negative discrepancies.\nImpact of using made‑up data—what limitations does this introduce?\nThe main impact and risks/limitations of using made up data seems to be the method chosen for evaluating the difference between the two polls. Depending on which poll value is subtracted from the other has a large impact on the final result. For ex. the results look much different in favor of one candidate for another when ABC_polls values are subtracted from CBS_polls values versus CBS_polls values are subtracted from ABC_polls values.\nHow you might collect or validate real poll data in a true analysis.\nOne strategy I would implement to collect or validate real poll data in a true analysis would be to label the difference specifically or to add a two bar visualization that shows the counts side by side to display the difference rather than using a subtraction method.\nInclude your R code (in a code chunk) and the generated plot.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf_polls$Name&lt;-as.factor(df_polls$Name)\n\n# Here is the bar chart showing the difference between CBS_poll-ABC_poll\nggplot(df_polls,aes(x=Name,y=Diff, color=Diff, fill=Diff))+\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")+\n  ylab(\"Difference between polls\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Difference between CBS_poll-ABC_poll\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Re-calculate the Diff column for the difference between ABC and CBS\ndf_polls$Diff&lt;-df_polls$ABC_poll-df_polls$CBS_poll\n\n# Here is the bar chart showing the difference between ABC_poll-CBS_poll\nggplot(df_polls,aes(x=Name,y=Diff, color=Diff, fill=Diff))+\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")+\n  ylab(\"Difference between polls\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Difference between ABC_poll-CBS_poll\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a screenshot of my updated Github repo with the script and link to the new Module 3 blog post:\nhttps://rwalshusf.quarto.pub/httpsrwalshusfquartopubr-programming-journal---robert-walsh/posts/Module%203/"

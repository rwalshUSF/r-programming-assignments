# Task: Develop an R package, publish it on GitHub, and share the repository link on Canvas

My fascination with finance is reflected in my coursework, inspiring me to apply my knowledge practically in my final project: developing the SimpleFinCalc R package. The package, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwalshUSF/SimpleFinCalc) includes essential functions for financial calculations, such as determining present and future values, analyzing cash flows, and calculating loan amortizations.

My goal was to create an intuitive, accessible tool that helps others easily grasp and apply these core financial principles. The process of translating complex financial theories into functional code further solidified my enthusiasm for the subject and honed my programming skills.

The process of creating an R package provided significant learning opportunities, particularly in understanding package structure and documentation. Key new skills I have sharpened include the effective use of Roxygen for generating documentation, which assists the creation of the help files and ensured consistent function descriptions. Setting up the DESCRIPTION file involved learning about package metadata, dependencies, and licensing, which are important for package information and attribution. The programming experience highlighted the importance of a well-organized file structure within the package directory for maintainability, installation, and collaboration.

I did encounter some technical challenges during development which mainly revolved around dependency management and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Resolving these issues often required meticulous debugging and exploring alternative approaches to function implementation. For instance, addressing specific errors related to external package interactions necessitated careful examination of package vignettes and community forums for solutions.

Looking ahead, the current package limitations include a lack of comprehensive unit testing and limited support for certain data types. Future enhancements will focus on implementing a robust testing framework to ensure code stability and expand functionality to handle a broader range of input data, potentially incorporating features like advanced visualization options or integration with other analytical tools.

```

## The 'SimpleFinCalc' R Package

```{r setup}
library(SimpleFinCalc)
```

The goal of the 'SimpleFinCalc' R package is to provide a straightforward suite of functions for performing common financial calculations, making it an excellent educational tool or quick-reference utility. It includes core functions for analyzing the time value of money, such as computing future and present values, as well as calculating loan payments. The package also features a function for generating a full amortization schedule, allowing users to easily break down loan payments into principal and interest over time. By encapsulating complex financial formulas into easy-to-use functions, SimpleFinCalc helps users perform essential financial analyses without the need for manual calculations, streamlining tasks for students, analysts, or anyone interested in personal finance.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SimpleFinCalc from [GitHub](https://github.com/rwalshUSF/SimpleFinCalc) with the 'devtools' package in R:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# library(devtools)
# install_github("rwalshUSF/SimpleFinCalc",build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Once the installation is complete, try these Rstudio help commands to access documentation:

```

## Data

The 'SimpleFinCalc' R package includes a built in data set 'profiles1' to assist in the testing and demonstration of the many functions that the packages includes. The 'profiles1' data set consists of 100 records for financial calculations including synthetic inputs for various loan, investment, and return calculations for use with the functions implemented in the 'SimpleFinCalc' package.

The data set is available when the package is installed and the library is loaded in to the R working environment. The data set can also be referenced with the data() function or ?profiles1 in the R Console.

This is how to access the help file for the built-in 'profiles1' data set:

```{r profiles1_help}
# library(SimpleFinCalc)
# ?profiles1
```

Here is a summary of the variables in the built-in 'profiles1' data set:

```{r profiles1_summary}
library(SimpleFinCalc)
summary(profiles1)
```

# --- 1. Time Value of Money (TVM) Functions ---

## fv_simple()

### Calculate the Future Value (FV) of a lump-sum investment (simple interest)

The fv_simple() function performs a 'Simple Future Value' calculation with robust input validation. It takes three variables; Principal, Rate, and Years, and returns the calculated value.

Simple Future Value - $FV = PV * (1 + r)^n$

```{r}
library(SimpleFinCalc)
# With user provided variables:
testP<-1000
testR<-5
testY<-10
fv_simple(testP,testR,testY)
# Therefore if a person had a Principal of $1000, at a Rate of .05% for 10 Years 
# they would have ~$1628.895 in the future!

# Using a record from the 'profiles1' data set

# Print the first record in the data set
profiles1[1,]

# Call the function using the 'profiles1[1]' data
fv_simple(profiles1$Principal[1],profiles1$Rate[1],profiles1$Years[1])
# Therefore if a person had a Principal of $457488.2, at a Rate of 0.13506535% 
# for 25 Years they would have ~$10861782.00 in the future!
```

## fv_compound()

### Calculate the Future Value (FV) of a lump-sum investment (compound interest).

The fv_compound() function performs a 'Compound Future Value' calculation with robust input validation. It takes four variables; Principal, Rate, Years, and N_Compounds; then returns the calculated value.

Compound Future Value - $FV = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)$

```{r}
# With user provided variables:
testP<-1000
testR<-5
testY<-10
testN<-4
fv_compound(testP,testR,testY,testN)
# Therefore if a person had a Principal of $1000, at a Rate of .05% for 10 Years, 
# that compounds 4 times a year; they would have ~$1643.619 in the future!

# Using a record from the 'profiles1' data set

# Print the first record in the data set
profiles1[1,]

# Call the function using the 'profiles1[1]' data
fv_compound(profiles1$Principal[1],profiles1$Rate[1],profiles1$Years[1],profiles1$N_Compounding[1])
# Therefore if a person had a Principal of $457488.2, at a Rate of 0.1350653% for 
# 25 Years, that compounds once a year; they would have ~$10861782.00 in the future!
```

## pv()

### Calculate the Present Value (PV) of a future sum of money.

The pv() function performs a 'Present Value' calculation with robust input validation. It takes three variables; Future_Value_Input, Rate, and Years; then returns the calculated value.

Present Value - $PV = FV / (1 + r)^n$

```{r}
# With user provided variables:
testF<-10000
testR<-5
testY<-10
pv(testF,testR,testY)
# Therefore if a person will have $10000 in the future, at an annual discount 
# Rate of .05%, receiving the money 10 Years from now; their money is worth 
# ~$6139.133 in the present!

# Using a record from the 'profiles1' data set

# Print the first record in the data set
profiles1[1,]

# Call the function using the 'profiles1[1]' data
pv(profiles1$Future_Value_Input[1],profiles1$Rate[1],profiles1$Years[1])
# Therefore if a person will have $1039037 in the future, at an annual discount 
# Rate of 0.1350653%, receiving the money 25 Years from now; their money is worth 
# ~$43763.29 in the present!
```

## annuity_payment()

### Calculate the fixed annuity payment amount for a loan or investment.

The annuity_payment() function performs an 'annuity_payment' calculation with robust input validation. It takes three variables; Principal, Rate, and Years; then returns the calculated value. The regular annual payment amount.

Fixed Annuity Payment - $payment = P * (r*(1 + r)^n)/((1 + r)^n-1)$

```{r}
# With user provided variables:
testP<-1000
testR<-5
testY<-10
annuity_payment(testP,testR,testY)
# Therefore if a person has $1000 in an annuity, at an annual Rate of .05%, 
# receiving payments for 10 Years; their regular payment is ~$129.5046!

# Using a record from the 'profiles1' data set

# Print the first record in the data set
profiles1[1,]

# Call the function using the 'profiles1[1]' data
annuity_payment(profiles1$Principal[1],profiles1$Rate[1],profiles1$Years[1])
# Therefore if a person has $457488.2 in an annuity, at an annual Rate of 
# 0.1350653%, receiving payments for 25 Years; their regular payment is 
# ~$64507.79!
```

# --- 2. Loan and Mortgage Calculation ---

## loan_payment()

### Calculate the fixed monthly payment for a loan.

The loan_payment() function performs a 'loan_payment' calculation with robust input validation. It takes three variables; Principal, Rate, and Years; then returns the calculated value. The fixed monthly payment.

Monthly Loan Payment - $payment = P*(r*(1 + r)^n/((1+r)^n-1)$

```{r}
# With user provided variables:
testP<-1000
testR<-5
testY<-10
loan_payment(testP,testR,testY)
# Therefore if a person borrows $1000, at an annual Rate of .05%, 
# for 10 Years; their fixed monthly loan payment is ~$10.60655!

# Using a record from the 'profiles1' data set

# Print the first record in the data set
profiles1[1,]

# Call the function using the 'profiles1[1]' data
loan_payment(profiles1$Principal[1],profiles1$Rate[1],profiles1$Years[1])
# Therefore if a person borrows $457488.2, at an annual Rate of 0.1350653%, 
# for 25 Years; their fixed monthly loan payment is ~$5334.956!
```

## amort_schedule()

### Create an amortization schedule data frame for a loan.

The 'amort_schedule()' function performs 'amort_schedule' calculations with robust input validation. It takes three variables; Principal, Rate, and Years; then returns A data frame showing the breakdown of each payment.

The 'amort_schedule' function relies on two core formulas and a sequential process:

Formula for the Fixed Monthly Payment (same as loan payment)

Monthly Loan Payment - $payment = P*(r*(1 + r)^n/((1+r)^n-1)$

Then, Formulas Used Within the Amortization Loop:

The function then iterates through each payment period (month) using a for loop and applies three simple formulas for each row:

Interest Payment: $Interest = Beginning Balance * monthly rate$

Principal Paid: $Principal Paid = Payment - Interest$

Ending Balance: $Ending Balance = Beginning Balance - Principal Paid$

```{r}
# With user provided variables:
testP<-1000
testR<-5
testY<-10
sched1<-amort_schedule(testP,testR,testY)
# The output is limited for space
head(sched1)

# Using a record from the 'profiles1' data set

# Print the first record in the data set
profiles1[1,]

# Call the function using the 'profiles1[1]' data
sched2<-amort_schedule(profiles1$Principal[1],profiles1$Rate[1],profiles1$Years[1])
# The output is limited for space
head(sched2)
```

# --- 3. Return and Growth Calculations ---

## cagr()

### Calculate the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of an investment.

The cagr() function performs a 'cagr' calculation with robust input validation. It takes three variables; Start_Value, End_Value, and Years; then returns the calculated value. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of an investment as a decimal.

$CAGR = ((endvalue / startvalue)^(1 / years)) - 1$

```{r}
# With user provided variables:
testSV<-1000
testEV<-15632
testY<-10
cagr(testSV,testEV,testY)
# Therefore if a person enters an investment worth $1000, and the investment is 
# worth $15632 after 10 Years; their CAGR is ~0.3164412!

# Using a record from the 'profiles1' data set

# Print the first record in the data set
profiles1[1,]

# Call the function using the 'profiles1[1]' data
cagr(profiles1$Start_Value[1],profiles1$End_Value[1],profiles1$Years[1])
# Therefore if a person enters an investment worth $457488.2, and the investment is 
# worth $1039037 after 25 Years; their CAGR is ~0.0333562!
```

## simple_return()

### Calculate the Simple Return (percentage change) of an investment.

The simple_return() function performs a 'simple_return' calculation with robust input validation. It takes two variables; Start_Price and End_Price; then returns the calculated value. The simple return as a decimal (e.g., 0.10 for 10%).

$Simple Return = (endprice - startprice) / startprice$

```{r}
# With user provided variables:
testSP<-1000
testEP<-15632
simple_return(testSP,testEP)
# Therefore if a person enters an investment that costs $1000, and the investment is 
# now worth $15632 their simple return rate is ~14.632!

# Using a record from the 'profiles1' data set

# Print the first record in the data set
profiles1[1,]

# Call the function using the 'profiles1[1]' data
simple_return(profiles1$Start_Price[1],profiles1$End_Price[1])
# Therefore if a person enters an investment that costs $457488.2, and the investment is 
# now worth $1039037 their simple return rate is ~1.271178!
```

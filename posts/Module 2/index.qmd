This my Module #2 post for my LIS4370 blog. Welcome!

Tasks \# 1 & 2

I have downloaded and reviewed the data import instructions. The 'readr' functions are more familiar to me than the 'tidyr' and I have experience reading and writing various data sets with .csv, .tsv, and html links. I have also read the assigned Chapters.

Task \# 3

Evaluate the 'myMean()' function:

```{r}
# Use the vector:

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

# Consider the function:

myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
}

# Run myMean(assignment2) and record the output or error:
myMean(assignment2)

# The result or error message from testing myMean(assignment2):
```

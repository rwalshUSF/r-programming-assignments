This my Module #2 post for my LIS4370 blog. Welcome!

Tasks \# 1 & 2

I have downloaded and reviewed the data import instructions. The 'readr' functions are more familiar to me than the 'tidyr' and I have experience reading and writing various data sets with .csv, .tsv, and html links. I have also read the assigned Chapters.

Task \# 3

Evaluate the 'myMean()' function:

```{r}
# Use the vector:

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

# Consider the function:

myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
}

# Run myMean(assignment2) and record the output or error:
myMean(assignment2)

# The result or error message from testing myMean(assignment2):
```

![](error.png)

The function call for 'myMean(assignment2)' fails because the variable names inside the functions instructions are incorrect. The function takes an argument or input parameter of 'assignment2' and the instructions attempt to reference objects named 'assignment' in the sum() function and 'someData' in the length() function.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true 
#| file: myMeanFunction.R
```

Here is a screenshot of my GitHub repository that shows the blog link and the corrected myMean function .R file: ![](mod2github.png)

This is an excellent project for this class project class because it's practical, involves mathematical R code formulas, and teaches fundamental R package development skills.\n\nThe Friedman R package provides a straightforward suite of functions for performing common financial calculations, making it an excellent educational tool or quick-reference utility. It includes core functions for analyzing the time value of money, such as computing future and present values, as well as calculating net present value and loan payments. The package also features a function for generating a full amortization schedule, allowing users to easily break down loan payments into principal and interest over time. By encapsulating complex financial formulas into easy-to-use functions, Friedman helps users perform essential financial analyses without the need for manual calculations, streamlining tasks for students, analysts, or anyone interested in personal finance.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFunction ideas:\n\n1 - Time value of money (TVM) TVM is a financial concept that's perfect for a simple package.\n\nFuture Value (FV): Calculates the future value of an investment with a lump-sum payment. fv_simple(principal, rate, years) fv_compound(principal, rate, years, n_comp) (where n_comp is the number of times compounded per year)\n\nPresent Value (PV): Calculates the current worth of a future sum of money. pv(future_value, rate, years)\n\nNet Present Value (NPV): Calculates the present value of a series of future cash flows. npv(rate, cash_flows)\n\nAnnuity Payments: Calculates the payment amount for a loan or investment with regular, equal payments. annuity_payment(principal, rate, years)\n\n2 - Loan and mortgage calculations This is a practical addition to the package.\n\nMonthly Payment: Calculates the fixed monthly payment for a loan. loan_payment(principal, rate, years)\n\nAmortization Schedule: Creates a data frame showing the breakdown of each payment into principal and interest over the life of a loan. amort_schedule(principal, rate, years)\n\n3 - Return and growth calculations For analyzing simple investment performance.\n\nCompound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): Calculates the average annual growth rate of an investment over a specific period. cagr(start_value, end_value, years)\n\nSimple Return: Calculates the percentage change in an investment's value. simple_return(start_price, end_price)\n",

Welcome!\n\nTasks \\# 1 & 2\n\nI have downloaded and reviewed the data import instructions. The 'readr' functions are more familiar to me than the 'tidyr' and I have experience reading and writing various data sets with .csv, .tsv, and html links. I have also read the assigned Chapters.\n\nTask \\# 3\n\nEvaluate the 'myMean()' function:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use the vector:\n\nassignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)\n\n# Consider the function:\n\nmyMean <- function(assignment2) {\n  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))\n}\n\n# Run myMean(assignment2) and record the output or error:\nmyMean(assignment2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in myMean(assignment2): object 'assignment' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The result or error message from testing myMean(assignment2):\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n![](error.png)\n\nThe function call for 'myMean(assignment2)' fails because the variable names inside the functions instructions are incorrect. The function takes an argument or input parameter of 'assignment2' and the instructions attempt to reference objects named 'assignment' in the sum() function and 'someData' in the length() function.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This is a corrected version of the myMean() function that correctly returns\n# the mean of 'assignment2'\n\nassignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)\n\nmyMean <- function(assignment2) {\n  return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))\n}\n\n# Run myMean(assignment2) and record the output:\nmyMean(assignment2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 19.25\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere is a screenshot of my GitHub repository that shows the blog link and the corrected myMean function .R file: ![](mod2github.png)\n\nBlog link:\n\n<https://rwalshusf.quarto.pub/httpsrwalshusfquartopubr-programming-journal---robert-walsh/>\n",

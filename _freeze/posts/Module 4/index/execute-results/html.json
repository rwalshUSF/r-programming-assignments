I am not a medical professional, however\n# blood pressure measurements of 32 seem impossibly low for a patient to be alive.\n# Extremely high blood pressure measurements could be caused by the patients\n# mood or current state of being stressed out or very relaxed. Making up data\n# in this case could have dangerous health consequences for patients.\n```\n:::\n",

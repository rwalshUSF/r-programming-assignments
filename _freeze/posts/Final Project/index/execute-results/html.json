Welcome!\n\nThe 'SimpleFinCalc' R Package can be accessed from this code repository:\n\n[![](simplefincalcgit.png)](simplefincalcgit.png)\n\n<https://github.com/rwalshUSF/SimpleFinCalc>\n\n<hr>\n\n# Task: Develop an R package, publish it on GitHub, and share the repository link on Canvas\n\nMy fascination with finance is reflected in my coursework, inspiring me to apply my knowledge practically in my final project: developing the SimpleFinCalc R package. The package, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwalshUSF/SimpleFinCalc) includes essential functions for financial calculations, such as determining present and future values, analyzing cash flows, and calculating loan amortizations.\n\nMy goal was to create an intuitive, accessible tool that helps others easily grasp and apply these core financial principles. The process of translating complex financial theories into functional code further solidified my enthusiasm for the subject and honed my programming skills.\n\nThe process of creating an R package provided significant learning opportunities, particularly in understanding package structure and documentation. Key new skills I have sharpened include the effective use of Roxygen for generating documentation, which assists the creation of the help files and ensured consistent function descriptions. Setting up the DESCRIPTION file involved learning about package metadata, dependencies, and licensing, which are important for package information and attribution. The programming experience highlighted the importance of a well-organized file structure within the package directory for maintainability, installation, and collaboration.\n\nI did encounter some technical challenges during development which mainly revolved around dependency management and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Resolving these issues often required meticulous debugging and exploring alternative approaches to function implementation. For instance, addressing specific errors related to external package interactions necessitated careful examination of package vignettes and community forums for solutions.\n\nLooking ahead, the current package limitations include a lack of comprehensive unit testing and limited support for certain data types. Future enhancements will focus on implementing a robust testing framework to ensure code stability and expand functionality to handle a broader range of input data, potentially incorporating features like advanced visualization options or integration with other analytical tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The 'SimpleFinCalc' R Package\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(SimpleFinCalc)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe goal of the 'SimpleFinCalc' R package is to provide a straightforward suite of functions for performing common financial calculations, making it an excellent educational tool or quick-reference utility. It includes core functions for analyzing the time value of money, such as computing future and present values, as well as calculating loan payments. The package also features a function for generating a full amortization schedule, allowing users to easily break down loan payments into principal and interest over time. By encapsulating complex financial formulas into easy-to-use functions, SimpleFinCalc helps users perform essential financial analyses without the need for manual calculations, streamlining tasks for students, analysts, or anyone interested in personal finance.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the development version of SimpleFinCalc from [GitHub](https://github.com/rwalshUSF/SimpleFinCalc) with the 'devtools' package in R:\n\n``` r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\n# library(devtools)\n# install_github(\"rwalshUSF/SimpleFinCalc\",build_vignettes = TRUE)\n```\n\nOnce the installation is complete, try these Rstudio help commands to access documentation:\n\n``` r\n# Ensure the package is loaded\n# library(SimpleFinCalc)\n\n# To access the Documentation for the package\n# help(package = \"SimpleFinCalc\")\n\n# To view the package Vignette\n# vignette(\"SimpleFinCalc\", package = \"SimpleFinCalc\")\n\n# To view the help file for the 'profiles1' data set\n# ?profiles1\n\n# To view the help files for the individual functions\n# ?fv_simple\n# ?fv_compound\n# ?pv\n# ?annuity_payment\n# ?loan_payment\n# ?amort_schedule\n# ?cagr\n# ?simple_return\n```\n\n## Data\n\nThe 'SimpleFinCalc' R package includes a built in data set 'profiles1' to assist in the testing and demonstration of the many functions that the packages includes. The 'profiles1' data set consists of 100 records for financial calculations including synthetic inputs for various loan, investment, and return calculations for use with the functions implemented in the 'SimpleFinCalc' package.\n\nThe data set is available when the package is installed and the library is loaded in to the R working environment. The data set can also be referenced with the data() function or ?profiles1 in the R Console.\n\nThis is how to access the help file for the built-in 'profiles1' data set:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# library(SimpleFinCalc)\n# ?profiles1\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nHere is a summary of the variables in the built-in 'profiles1' data set:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(SimpleFinCalc)\nsummary(profiles1)\n#>    Principal           Rate             Years       N_Compounding  \n#>  Min.   :  1119   Min.   :0.02228   Min.   : 1.00   Min.   : 1.00  \n#>  1st Qu.:130577   1st Qu.:0.04429   1st Qu.:10.00   1st Qu.: 1.00  \n#>  Median :270317   Median :0.07364   Median :18.00   Median : 4.00  \n#>  Mean   :262715   Mean   :0.07730   Mean   :16.59   Mean   : 5.36  \n#>  3rd Qu.:382043   3rd Qu.:0.09891   3rd Qu.:23.25   3rd Qu.:12.00  \n#>  Max.   :494457   Max.   :0.14955   Max.   :30.00   Max.   :12.00  \n#>  Future_Value_Input  Start_Value       End_Value        Start_Price    \n#>  Min.   :   2886    Min.   :  1119   Min.   :   2886   Min.   :  1119  \n#>  1st Qu.: 239745    1st Qu.:130577   1st Qu.: 239745   1st Qu.:130577  \n#>  Median : 494020    Median :270317   Median : 494020   Median :270317  \n#>  Mean   : 539392    Mean   :262715   Mean   : 539392   Mean   :262715  \n#>  3rd Qu.: 831580    3rd Qu.:382043   3rd Qu.: 831580   3rd Qu.:382043  \n#>  Max.   :1325829    Max.   :494457   Max.   :1325829   Max.   :494457  \n#>    End_Price      \n#>  Min.   :   2886  \n#>  1st Qu.: 239745  \n#>  Median : 494020  \n#>  Mean   : 539392  \n#>  3rd Qu.: 831580  \n#>  Max.   :1325829\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# --- 1.
